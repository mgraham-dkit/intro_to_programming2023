# This program shows how you do a basic running total
# Start by creating the total variable and setting it to 0
total = 0

# Repeat this step 10 times, with i starting at 0 and ending at 9
# (It will add together all the values from 0 to 9)
for i in range(10):
    # Add the new value to the current running total value
    total = total + i
 
# Display the final total value to the user
print("The overall total was:", i)
